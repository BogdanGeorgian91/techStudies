Native 0.78 using React 19’s useOptimistic hook! This game-changing hook lets you update the UI instantly while waiting for server responses, creating a snappy, responsive feel in your mobile apps—perfect for actions like liking posts or toggling settings.

With useOptimistic, the UI reflects the user’s action (liking/unliking) instantly, while the server syncs in the background. If the API fails, you can roll back to the original state, keeping the experience seamless. This approach is ideal for React Native apps where perceived performance is key.

I’m loving how useOptimistic makes mobile apps feel lightning-fast!
