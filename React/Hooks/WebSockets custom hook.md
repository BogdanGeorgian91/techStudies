Want live updates in your React Native app—like chat messages or notifications? Polling APIs is clunky, but WebSockets bring real-time magic. 

Why it’s fire:

✅ Native WebSocket support—no extra libs needed.
✅ Updates state instantly as messages arrive.
✅ Cleans up on unmount to keep things tidy.

Perfect for chats, live scores, or alerts. Add reconnection logic for production.
