This React hook is criminally underrated!

useSyncExternalStore might be the most powerful React hook you've never used.

It solves a specific but critical problem: connecting React to external data sources without triggering unnecessary re-renders.

Here's what makes it incredible:
1️⃣ It syncs with ANY external data source (not just Redux)
2️⃣ It's built directly into React - no extra dependencies
3️⃣ It renders components ONLY when your data actually changes
4️⃣ It's specifically designed to handle external subscriptions properly
5️⃣ It avoids tearing issues in concurrent mode

A perfect example is subscribing to window size. Check it out in the image. 

No unnecessary re-renders. No dependency arrays to manage. No stale closures. Just clean, performant, React-friendly code
