1. Planning is 80% of success. Write your feature spec BEFORE opening Claude. AI amplifies clarity or confusion, your choice

2. AI can build anything with the right context. Give screenshots, file structures, database schemas, API docs, everything

3. XML formatted prompts work 3x better than plaintext. LLMs parse structured data natively

4. Stop building one mega agent. Build many specialized ones that do ONE thing perfectly

5. MCPs save 80% of context and prevent memory loss. Non-negotiable for serious work

6. At 50% token limit, start fresh. Compaction progressively degrades output quality

7. Create custom commands for repetitive tasks. Two hours saved daily, minimum

8. Claude Code hooks are criminally underused. Set once, benefit forever

9. One feature per chat, always. Mixing features is coding drunk

10. After every completion: "Review your work and list what might be broken"

11. Screenshots provide 10x more context than text. Drag directly into terminal

12. Loop tests until it actually works. "Should work" means it doesn't

13. Keep rules files under 100 lines. Concise beats comprehensive

14. Write tests BEFORE code. TDD with AI prevents debugging nightmares

15. Maintain PROJECT\_CONTEXT.md updated after each session for continuity

16. For fixes: "Fix this without changing anything else" prevents cascade failures

17. Separate agents for frontend/backend/database work better than one

18. "Explain what you changed and why" forces actual understanding

19. Set checkpoints: "Stop after X and wait" prevents runaway changes

20. Git commit after EVERY working feature. Reverting beats fixing

21. Generate a debug plan before debugging. Random attempts waste tokens

22. "Write code your future self can modify" produces 10x cleaner output

23. Keep DONT\_DO.md with past failures. AI forgets but you shouldn't

24. Start each session with: project context, rules, what not to do

25. If confused, the AI is too. Clarify for yourself first

26. Have pre-defined agents and rules FOR YOUR techstack. I find websites like [vibecodingtools.tech](http://vibecodingtools.tech) and [cursor.directory](http://cursor.directory) pretty useful for this
