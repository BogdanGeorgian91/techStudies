Adding geolocation magic to React Native apps! In React Native 0.78, libraries like @react-native-community/geolocation make it easy to access device location, enabling features like maps, nearby services, or tracking. With TypeScript, you get type-safe location data for robust mobile apps.

This code handles permissions, fetches coordinates with @react-native-community/geolocation, and uses TypeScript for type-safe Coordinates. It’s perfect for location-based features like showing nearby restaurants or tracking routes. Pro tip: Combine with a map library like react-native-maps for a full experience!
