Making React Native apps buttery-smooth with React 19’s concurrent rendering! In React Native 0.78, concurrent rendering lets you prioritize critical UI updates, ensuring your mobile apps stay responsive even during heavy data loads or complex renders. Think seamless scrolling or instant UI feedback—users will love it!

Using startTransition, the app prioritizes user interactions (like scrolling) over non-urgent updates (like appending list items), preventing jank. This is huge for React Native apps with dynamic lists, heavy computations, or real-time data.
