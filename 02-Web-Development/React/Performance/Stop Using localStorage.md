🚀 Stop Using localStorage for Everything! Here’s Why You Should Rethink It  
  
Many developers still rely on localStorage, but it comes with major drawbacks!  
  
⚠ Why localStorage is a Bad Idea:  
❌ Not Secure – Data is exposed and can be stolen via XSS attacks.  
❌ Blocks Performance – It’s synchronous, slowing down your app.  
❌ Limited Storage – Max 5MB  
  
💡 What Should You Use Instead?  
✅ IndexedDB – Asynchronous, secure, supports large data.  
✅ Session Storage – Great for temporary data (clears after session).  
✅ Cookies (httpOnly) – Best for authentication (safer from XSS).
