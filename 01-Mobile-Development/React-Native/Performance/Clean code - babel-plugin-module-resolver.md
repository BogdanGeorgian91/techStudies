Starting a React Native project? 
A clean project structure is key to staying organized and scaling smoothly. 
Instead of grouping files by type (e.g., all components in one folder), try a feature-based structure. 
Group related files (components, screens, hooks) by feature, like auth, profile, or dashboard. This makes navigation and collaboration easier, especially in larger teams.  
  
This keeps your code clean and maintainable.  
  
Pro Tip: Use babel-plugin-module-resolver to simplify
