i have no price/mechanism recommendations, that's your journey to go through

as for tools:

•	⁠sign up for revenue cat (works with apple and google, everybody uses this)
•	⁠build the paywalls using superwall. you can change anything and everything after the app is published. if you register events for most stuff in the app, you could even toggle paywalls for different features (and test which one converts best)

both of them are free, and after a certain point they take a cut from the purchases (smaller than stripe for comparison)

one point i've discovered is that most apps that make money and get into those "how did this team get to #2 on appstore" twitter threads is they have a hard paywall, you cannot use the app if you do not pay.
