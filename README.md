- **Primary Focus:** React Native (68 files), iOS Native (99 files)
- **Last Organized:** November 2025

## 🎯 Organization Principles

1. **Domain-Based Structure** - Content organized by technology domain with numbered prefixes for logical ordering
2. **Clear Separation** - Web (React) vs Mobile (React Native) vs Native (iOS) clearly distinguished
3. **Room for Growth** - Structure designed to accommodate new content and technologies
4. **Consistent Naming** - Title Case for files, hyphenated folder names

## 📝 File Naming Conventions

- **Title Case:** All file names use Title Case (e.g., "React Native Performance.md")
- **Descriptive:** Names describe content purpose, not implementation details
- **No Temporal Markers:** Avoid "new", "old", "legacy" in names
- **English Primary:** English as primary language for consistency
