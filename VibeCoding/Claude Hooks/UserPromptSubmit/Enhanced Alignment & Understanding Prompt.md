# Enhanced Alignment & Understanding Prompt

## Core Prompt

**Before proceeding with implementation, let's ensure complete alignment. Please provide a comprehensive understanding check by addressing the following:**

### 1. REQUIREMENT ARTICULATION

Re-articulate in your own words each concrete and specific requirement I've provided. For each requirement, please specify:

- **What**: The exact requirement as you understand it
- **Why**: The purpose/goal this requirement serves
- **How**: The technical approach you'll take
- **Actions**: Specific actions needed to fulfill this requirement
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll know this requirement is met

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

Provide a detailed implementation approach including:

- **Architecture Overview**: High-level design and component structure
- **Technology Stack**: Specific tools, libraries, and frameworks you'll use
- **Data Flow**: How information will move through the system
- **State Management**: How you'll handle application state
- **Error Handling**: Your approach to managing failures and edge cases

### 3. EXECUTION PLAN

Break down the implementation into:

- **Sequential Tasks** (must be done in order):
    - List each task with dependencies
    - Estimated complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
    - Critical path items
- **Parallel Tasks** (can be done simultaneously):
    - Group related tasks that can be executed concurrently
    - Resource allocation strategy
- **Sub-Agent Utilization**:
    - Which Sub-Agents you'll employ and for what purpose
    - How Sub-Agents will coordinate
    - Expected outputs from each Sub-Agent

### 4. LOGICAL REORGANIZATION

Reorganize all requirements into their optimal implementation sequence:

1. **Foundation** (Prerequisites and setup)
2. **Core Features** (Primary functionality)
3. **Enhancements** (Secondary features)
4. **Polish** (Optimization and refinement)

For each phase, indicate:

- Dependencies (both internal and external)
- Potential blockers or risks
- Validation checkpoints

### 5. RISK ASSESSMENT

Identify potential challenges:

- **Technical Risks**: What could go wrong technically?
- **Assumption Risks**: What assumptions are we making?
- **Mitigation Strategies**: How will you handle these risks?

### 6. COMPREHENSIVE TODO LIST

Provide a complete, actionable TODO list in this format:

```
## TODO List

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Task 1 (Priority: High)
  - Subtask 1.1
  - Subtask 1.2
- [ ] Task 2 (Priority: Medium)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Task 3 (Priority: High)
- [ ] Task 4 (Priority: High)

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Task 5 (Priority: High)

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Task 6 (Priority: Low)
```

### 7. CLARIFICATION REQUESTS

If any aspects are unclear or ambiguous:

- **Ambiguities**: List any unclear requirements
- **Assumptions**: State assumptions you're making
- **Questions**: Specific questions that need answers
- **Alternatives**: Suggest alternatives if requirements conflict

### 8. CONFIRMATION CHECKPOINT

**Before Implementation Begins:**

- Summarize the core objective in one sentence
- State the primary success metric
- Confirm the most critical requirement
- Estimate total implementation time

---

**Please provide this comprehensive understanding check and then WAIT for my explicit confirmation before proceeding with any implementation. If I need to clarify or adjust anything, we'll iterate until we achieve perfect alignment.**

_Type "Confirmed - proceed with implementation" or provide corrections/clarifications._

---

## Alternative Shorter Version

If you prefer a more concise version:

**Before implementing, please confirm my understanding:**

1. **Requirements Summary**: Re-state each requirement in your own words with the specific actions you'll take
    
2. **Implementation Order**: Reorganize requirements into logical sequence with dependencies noted
    
3. **Execution Strategy**:
    - What will be done sequentially (and why)
    - What can be done in parallel
    - How you'll use Sub-Agents
4. **TODO List**: Complete task list with priorities and time estimates
    
5. **Questions/Clarifications**: Any ambiguities that need resolution
    

**Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Usage Tips

### When to Use the Full Version:

- Complex projects with multiple components
- First-time collaboration on a project type
- When requirements have many interdependencies
- Mission-critical implementations

### When to Use the Short Version:

- Simple, straightforward tasks
- Follow-up iterations on established patterns
- Time-sensitive quick implementations
- When you've already established good alignment

### Customization Options:

Feel free to add or remove sections based on your specific needs:

- Add "Budget Constraints" for resource-limited projects
- Add "Performance Requirements" for optimization-focused tasks
- Add "Integration Points" for systems that connect with others
- Add "Documentation Needs" for projects requiring extensive docs
- Remove "Sub-Agent Utilization" if not using Sub-Agents

### Best Practices:

1. Use this prompt immediately after providing requirements
2. Review the response carefully before confirming
3. Don't hesitate to iterate - alignment saves time
4. Be specific in corrections if something is misunderstood
5. Save the alignment summary for future reference
