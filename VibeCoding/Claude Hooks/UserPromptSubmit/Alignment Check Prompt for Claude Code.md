# Alignment Check Prompt for Claude Code

## The Prompt

**Before implementing, let's ensure we're perfectly aligned. Please provide:**

### 1. UNDERSTANDING CHECK

Re-articulate each requirement in your own words, including:

- What you need to build/do
- The specific actions you'll take
- How you'll know it's complete

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Describe your technical approach:

- Overall strategy in 2-3 sentences
- Key tools/libraries you'll use
- How you'll handle the main challenges

### 3. EXECUTION ORDER

Reorganize requirements into logical implementation sequence:

- **Sequential tasks** (must be done in order - note dependencies)
- **Parallel tasks** (can be done simultaneously)
- **Sub-Agents needed** (which ones and for what)

### 4. TODO LIST

```
Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task with (Priority: H/M/L)
- [ ] Task with (Priority: H/M/L)

Phase 2: [Name]
- [ ] Task with (Priority: H/M/L)
- [ ] Task with (Priority: H/M/L)
```

### 5. CLARIFICATIONS

- Any assumptions I should know about?
- Any requirements that seem unclear?
- Any potential issues you foresee?

**Summary**: [One sentence describing the main goal]
