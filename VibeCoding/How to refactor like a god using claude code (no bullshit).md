Since I think I'm good at refactoring any file with claude code I thought about dropping a quick guide on how I do it. No matter how big or complex the file to refactor is:

1. Ask CC to generate an .md document explaining how the file to be refactored is used on your codebase.

2. Now ask CC again to generate a detailed .md plan file explaining how the refactor would be accomplished in very detailed steps (without implementing it yet)

3. Head over to any LLM (I use claude desktop for example) and after chosing the right model (Sonnet 4.5 for smaller refactors or Opus 4.1 for bigger ones), attach the both files generated previously + the file to refactor (if it's not too big), and use this prompt:


        After analyzing the following attached files, I want you to give me the prompts (following the project guidelines) to refactor the <file name goes here> file (which I have also attached) into smaller elements without EVER breaking its functionality, just modularizing it.

        When writing the prompts, remember that:

        * They must be able to be followed by Claude code without getting lost at any point.

        * There should be no implementation gaps.

        * Only import tests should be run with the new files created in each phase of the process to ensure compatibility at all times.

        * You do not need to write explicit source code, just clear and concise instructions for Claude Code to carry out the task.

        * The last prompt must be a deep review.

  
Now copy and paste every prompt generated by Claude Desktop into Claude code with the /refactor customized command (get it [here](https://pastebin.com/Tn2pCDdW)) and voila. Get claude code to work.

Note: 
If the refactor is complex, use the thinking mode (press tab), but be careful because that consumes a shit ton of tokens.

Pro tip: 
Don't let claude code compact conversations. If you are close to it without the refactor being completed, clear the current session context and force claude code to analyze the context from the generated files in step 1 and 2. Then carry on with the next prompt.

# Refactor command

# 🏗️ SAFE REFACTORING ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL
 
**Core Philosophy: IMPROVE CODE WITHOUT BREAKING ANYTHING**
 
You are working on the current project. The user has requested to refactor specific files tagged with @ symbols in their arguments: "$ARGUMENTS"
 
## 🎯 PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: SAFETY FIRST
 
**Your mission is to improve code quality while maintaining 100% functionality.**
 
### Non-Negotiable Safety Rules:
1. ✅ **Preserve ALL existing functionality** - Zero breaking changes allowed
2. ✅ **Maintain type safety** - All TypeScript types must remain intact
3. ✅ **Verify imports** - Every import must resolve correctly after refactoring
4. ✅ **Follow project patterns** - Use existing conventions, don't invent new ones
5. ✅ **Test compatibility** - Ensure all consuming code continues to work
6. ✅ **Incremental validation** - Check each step before proceeding
 
### Risk Mitigation Framework:
- **Before touching code**: Understand ALL dependencies and usage patterns
- **During refactoring**: Preserve exact behavior, only improve structure
- **After changes**: Validate that nothing broke (imports, types, functionality)
 
---
 
## 📋 AUTO-LOADED PROJECT CONTEXT
 
These files provide critical context for safe refactoring:
- @/CLAUDE.md - Project standards, patterns, and best practices
- @/docs/ai-context/project-structure.md - Architecture and organization
- @/docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md - Documentation patterns
 
**CRITICAL**: Always consult these before making structural decisions.
 
---
 
## 🔍 STEP 1: PARSE TAGGED FILES
 
Extract all @ tagged file paths from the user's arguments. **Only process files explicitly tagged with @ symbols.**
 
### Parsing Rules:
- ✅ **Extract**: Files with @ prefix (e.g., `@src/big-file.ts`)
- ❌ **Ignore**: Non-tagged text, descriptions, or instructions
- ⚠️ **Validate**: Check each path exists before proceeding
 
**Example:**
```
Input: "refactor @src/components/LargeComponent.tsx it's too big"
Extract: ["src/components/LargeComponent.tsx"]
```
 
---
 
## 🔎 STEP 2: VALIDATE AND DEEP ANALYSIS
 
For each tagged file, perform comprehensive pre-refactoring analysis:
 
### 2.1 File Existence Validation
```
□ Verify file exists at exact path
□ If missing: Report to user and skip
□ If exists: Proceed to analysis
```
 
### 2.2 Complete File Understanding
```
□ Read entire file contents
□ Identify all exports (functions, types, constants)
□ Map internal dependencies and structure
□ Note any special patterns or conventions used
□ Identify complexity hotspots
```
 
### 2.3 Dependency Network Discovery
```
□ Find ALL files that import from this file
□ Identify external dependencies this file uses
□ Map the complete dependency graph
□ Check for circular dependencies
□ Note any global state or side effects
```
 
### 2.4 Project Context Analysis
```
□ Review surrounding directory structure
□ Identify similar files and their organization
□ Understand naming conventions in this area
□ Check for existing test files
□ Review related documentation
```
 
---
 
## 🧠 STEP 3: INTELLIGENT STRATEGY DECISION
 
**Think deeply before acting.** Choose the safest and most effective approach based on complexity and risk level.
 
### Strategy Selection Matrix:
 
#### ✅ DIRECT REFACTORING (0-1 sub-agents)
**When to use:**
- File is straightforward with obvious split points
- Minimal external dependencies (<5 importing files)
- Standard patterns (extract utils, split UI/logic)
- Low risk of breaking changes
- Well-isolated functionality
 
**Example:** Utility file with independent helper functions
 
---
 
#### ⚙️ FOCUSED ANALYSIS (2-3 sub-agents)
**When to use:**
- Moderate complexity with specific concerns
- Medium dependency footprint (5-15 importing files)
- One aspect needs deep investigation (dependencies OR structure)
- Some risk of breaking changes
- Requires careful import management
 
**Example:** Component with business logic and multiple consumers
 
---
 
#### 🔬 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS (4+ sub-agents)
**When to use:**
- High complexity with multiple interrelated concerns
- Extensive dependency network (15+ importing files)
- Novel refactoring patterns not seen in project
- High risk of breaking changes
- Central to multiple systems or features
- Complex type hierarchies or generics
 
**Example:** Core service file used throughout application
 
---
 
### Risk Assessment Checklist:
 
**Low Risk Indicators:**
- [ ] File is isolated with few consumers
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Simple import/export structure
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Minimal global state
 
**High Risk Indicators:**
- [ ] Used by many files across project
- [ ] Complex type dependencies
- [ ] Circular dependency chains
- [ ] Side effects or global state
- [ ] Critical business logic
 
---
 
## ⚡ STEP 4: EXECUTE CHOSEN STRATEGY
 
### For Direct Refactoring:
Proceed with straightforward refactoring using initial analysis and project context.
 
**Safety Checklist:**
- [ ] Review project patterns before making changes
- [ ] Preserve exact functionality
- [ ] Maintain all exports with same signatures
- [ ] Update imports systematically

---
 
### For Sub-Agent Approaches:
 
**YOU HAVE COMPLETE AUTONOMY** to design and launch custom sub-agents based on specific refactoring needs.
 
#### Core Investigation Areas:
 
**1. File Structure Analysis**
- Component boundaries and cohesion
- Logical split points
- Single Responsibility Principle compliance
- Opportunities for abstraction
 
**2. Dependency Network Mapping**
- All files importing from target
- External dependencies used
- Circular dependency detection
- Import path impact analysis
 
**3. Project Pattern Compliance**
- Directory structure conventions
- Naming patterns
- Export/import organization
- File size and complexity norms
 
**4. Impact Assessment**
- Test files requiring updates
- Configuration files affected
- Build scripts dependencies
- Documentation updates needed
 
**5. Type Safety Analysis**

---
 
#### Autonomous Sub-Agent Design Principles:
 
**Custom Specialization:**
Design agents for the specific file's unique challenges. Don't use generic agents when custom investigation is needed.
 
**Flexible Agent Count:**
Use exactly as many agents as needed - no more, no less. Scale based on actual complexity and risk.
 
**Adaptive Coverage:**
Ensure all high-risk aspects are investigated without unnecessary overlap.
 
**Parallel Execution:**
**CRITICAL**: Always launch sub-agents in parallel using a single message with multiple Task tool invocations for maximum efficiency.
 
---

## 🔨 STEP 7: EXECUTE REFACTORING
 
**Only execute after passing Step 6 assessment or receiving user confirmation.**
 
### Execution Order (CRITICAL - Follow Sequence):
 
**Phase 1: Directory Preparation**
```
1. Create new directories (if needed)
2. Verify directory structure matches project patterns
3. Ensure no naming conflicts
```
 
**Phase 2: File Creation (Bottom-Up)**
```
1. Create type definition files first
2. Create constant/enum files
3. Create utility/helper files
4. Create core functionality files
5. Create index/barrel files (if applicable)
```
 
**Phase 3: Content Migration**
```
1. Copy code to new files with exact preservation
2. Maintain all exports with same names/signatures
3. Preserve comments and documentation
4. Keep formatting consistent
```
 
**Phase 4: Import/Export Restructuring**
```
1. Update internal imports within split files
2. Create proper exports from new files
3. Set up re-exports if needed for compatibility
4. Verify no circular dependencies created
```
 
**Phase 5: Consumer Updates**
```
1. Find ALL files importing from original file
2. Update import paths systematically
3. Verify imports resolve correctly
4. Check for any dynamic imports
```
 
**Phase 6: Original File Update**
```
1. Replace with new modular structure OR
2. Convert to barrel file re-exporting from splits OR
3. Remove if no longer needed (after updating all consumers)
```
 
---
 
### Import/Export Management - DETAILED:
 
**Export Preservation:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (original file)
export function utilityA() { }
export function utilityB() { }
export type MyType = { }
 
// AFTER (new files)
// file-a.ts
export function utilityA() { }
 
// file-b.ts
export function utilityB() { }
 
// types.ts
export type MyType = { }
 
// index.ts (barrel file - optional for backward compatibility)
export { utilityA } from './file-a'
export { utilityB } from './file-b'
export type { MyType } from './types'
```
 
**Import Path Updates:**
```typescript
// Consuming file BEFORE
import { utilityA, MyType } from '../utils/original-file'
 
// Consuming file AFTER (Option 1 - direct imports)
import { utilityA } from '../utils/file-a'
import { MyType } from '../utils/types'
 
// Consuming file AFTER (Option 2 - barrel file)
import { utilityA, MyType } from '../utils' // if index.ts exists
```
 
**Type Safety Verification:**
```
□ All type exports preserved
□ Generic types maintain parameters
